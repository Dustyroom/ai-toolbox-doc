With {{ site.title_short }}, you can chat with **ChatGPT** and **Google Gemini** within Unity. You can ask AI to explain the code, ask it for a list scripts to implement for a certain feature, an advice on game mechanics, etc. You even ask questions unrelated to Unity, just make sure to uncheck the _Unity developer_ checkbox in the _Settings_ foldout.

If the AI outputs any piece of code, you have an option to save it as a file in the project.

To open the **Chat with AI** window, go to _Window_ ▶︎ _{{ site.title_short }}_ ▶︎ _Chat with AI_, or use the shortcut: `Alt+Shift+C` (Windows) or `Option+Shift+C` (Mac).

Once you open the chat window, you are good to ask away. You'll see the _Send a message_ field where you can type your message in the bottom of the window. Type your prompt and press the send button, shortcut: `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd+Return` (Mac).

- **'Pencil' button** - Edit a previous message to make another generation attempt.
- **Copy button** - Copy the AI response to clipboard.
- **Save button** - Saves the _code_ within the AI response as a file in the project. The file name is generated by AI.
- **Regenerate response** - Tries generating another variation of the reply from AI to your latest prompt. If the Temperature is set to 0 in the _Settings_ foldout menu (described below), this will generate the same response.
- **'Paper airplane' button** - Send the message. Shortcut: `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd+Return` (Mac).
- **Settings** - Expands and collapses the foldout menu revealing the settings applicable to the chat.
  - **Unity developer** - AI assumes a role of a Unity developer. If disabled, AI has no specific role.
  - **Temperature** - Controls randomness. Lower values result in less surprising answers. As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and repetitive. Higher values result in more random answers.
  - **Chatbot** - Select the AI Backend to use for generating the responses in freeform chat. Currently, there are the following options: _OpenAI ChatGPT_, _Azure ChatGPT_ and _Google Gemini_. The default chatbot is _OpenAI ChatGPT_. **This selects the chatbot for the chat only** — the chatbot used for other generation purposes (scripts, images etc) can be changed in each of those windows' settings. **If the _Chatbot_ menu is grayed out, in order to change the chatbot, you'll need to clear the chat history first (see _Clear_ button description below).**
  - **Model** - Select the GPT model to use. This is the list of supported models by the selected chatbot. We're constantly updating the list with new models as they are released.  
      Due to limitations in Unity UI prior to 2022.1, the model selection dropdown is supported only in Unity 2022.1 and later. In earlier versions, the model selection is done in the _{{ site.title_short }}_ settings.

- **Clear** - Clear the chat history. Clearing is necessary if you want to change the Chatbot.
- **'Download' button** - Export the chat history to a file.
- **GPT model** (on the window footer) - Indicates which [chatbot and model](/getting-started/#gpt-model) is being used for the chat generation.


Chat results including code explanations, how-to's, etc largely depend on the [GPT model](/getting-started/#gpt-model) you are using.
