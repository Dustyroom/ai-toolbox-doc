Setting up **Gemini** in {{ site.title_short }} consists of the following steps:

1. Set up a *Google Cloud project* using *Google AI Studio*,
1. Configure access to Gemini from Unity.

Let's go through these steps in detail.

## Set up a Google Cloud project

First, you need to create a *Google Cloud project* and get an *API key*.
This is a one-time process that takes a few minutes. After that, you can use Gemini in any {{ site.title_short }} project.

To do this, log into **Google AI Studio** and create and *API key* on the following page: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey){:target="_blank"}

If you don't have a Google account, you will need to create one. You can use your existing email address or create a new one.

You can either create a new project or use an existing one. In either case, *Google AI Studio* will automatically configure the project for you.

Once you have created the *API key*, save it to use in the next step.

## Configure access to Gemini from Unity

Now you need to set up access to the project from your Unity Editor.

1. In Unity, go to **Edit > Project Settings**.
1. Select **{{ site.title_short }}** from the list on the left.
1. Under **Google Gemini** tab, paste the *API key* you obtained in the previous step into the **API Key** field.
