The `ChatGpt` Text To Speech (TTS) API is a simple way to generate speech from text.

## Sample Scene

The best way to get started with the _Text To Speech_ is to open the `[Demo] Text To Speech` scene in the `Assets/AiToolbox/Samples/Runtime Usage` folder.

Type the text in the text field, select the Vioce model and click the **Process** button.

If you'd like to stop the processing, click the **Stop** button.

To get the generated audio file, click the **Export** button.

If you don't hear any audio, please make sure your _Mute Audio_ button in the _Game_ panel is not active.
