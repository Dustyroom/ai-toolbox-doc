The `ChatGpt` Text To Speech (TTS) API is a simple way to generate speech from text.

Please note that [OpenAI's policy](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies){:target="_blank"} requires you to provide a clear disclosure to end users that the TTS voice they are hearing is AI-generated and not a human voice.
