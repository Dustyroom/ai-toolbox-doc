The **Speech-to-text API** does speech recognition and converts spoken words in audio files into written text. Internally, it uses OpenAI [Whisper model](https://openai.com/research/whisper){:target="_blank"}.

## Sample Scene

The best way to get started with the _Text To Speech_ is to open the `[Demo] Speech To Text` scene in the `Assets/AiToolbox/Samples/Runtime Usage` folder.

Select the _Microphone_ input device and click the _Record_ button to start recording. Once you're done, click the _Stop_ button to stop the recording.

To transcribe the text, press the _Transcribe_ button. The generated text will be displayed in the _Transcription_ field.

<!-- To save the transcribed text, please select the _Export_ button. -->

<!-- If you don't hear any audio, please make sure your _Mute Audio_ button in the _Game_ panel is not active.
