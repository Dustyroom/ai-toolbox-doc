The **Text To Speech (TTS) API** is a simple way to generate very realistic speech audio clips from text.

Please note that [OpenAI's policy](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies){:target="_blank"} requires you to provide a clear disclosure to end users that the TTS voice they are hearing is AI-generated and not a human voice.

## Sample Scene

The best way to get started with the _Text To Speech_ is to open the `[Demo] Text To Speech` scene in the `Assets/AiToolbox/Samples/Runtime Usage` folder.

Type the text in the text field, select the [Vioce option](#voice-options) and click the **Process** button. The maximum length is 4096 characters.

If you'd like to stop the processing, click the **Stop** button.

To get the generated audio file, click the **Export** button.

If you don't hear any audio, please make sure your _Mute Audio_ button in the _Game_ panel is not active.
