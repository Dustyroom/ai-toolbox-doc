### Downloading and Importing AI Toolbox
First of all, you need to download and import {{ site.title_short }} into your project.

  * In Unity, go to **Window** ▶︎ **Package Manager**;
  * On the top left, please locate the **Packages** drop down menu. Select **My Assets** item there. You’ll find **{{ site.title }}** among your assets. Choose the version you’d like to import;
  * Click **Download** (if it is not downloaded yet);

### Configuring access to AI services

After the import is complete, you will need to configure the AI backend using one or more of the following methods:
* [OpenAI](/openai-set-up/)
* [Microsoft Azure](/azure-set-up/)
* [Google Gemini](/gemini-set-up/)
* [Ollama](/ollama-set-up/).
