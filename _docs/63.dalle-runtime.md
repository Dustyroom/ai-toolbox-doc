## Overview

The `{{ site.dalle }}` class provides a simple and convenient way to interact with the [{{ site.dalle }} API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat){:target="_blank"}. It allows you to send requests to the {{ site.dalle }} API and receive the response either all at once or in chunks as it is generated.

## Sample Scene

The best way to get started with the {{ site.dalle }} API is to open the `[Demo] Image Generation` scene in the `Assets/AiToolbox/Samples/Runtime Usage/[Demo] Image Generation` folder. This scene demonstrates how to use the `{{ site.dalle }}` class to send requests to the {{ site.dalle }} API and receive the response.

The API Key, Model, and other settings are exposed in the Inspector panel. More info, please scroll down to the [Parameters Class](#parameters-class) section.

## Quick Start

To generate images in code instead of the component above, you can use the static methods of the `Dalle` class.

### Request

Sends a request to {{ site.dalle }} and receives the response. The response is provided in the `completeCallback` function. If the request fails, the `failureCallback` function is called.

```csharp
public static Action Request(string prompt,
                             DalleParameters parameters,
                             Action<Texture2D> completeCallback,
                             Action<long, string> failureCallback)
```

**Parameters**
- `prompt`: Description of the image to generate, e.g., "A cat sitting on a table".
- `parameters`: Settings of the request, represented by a [`Parameters`](#parameters-class) object.
- `completeCallback`: The function to be called on successful completion. The generated texture is provided as a parameter.
- `failureCallback`: The function to be called on failure. Error code and message are provided as parameters. See [Error Handling](#error-handling) for more information.

**Returns**
- A function that can be called to cancel the request.

### CancelAllRequests

Cancels all pending requests to the {{ site.dalle }} API.

```csharp
public static void CancelAllRequests()
```

## Parameters Class

Represents the settings for the AI Toolbox {{ site.dalle }} requests.

The best way to use the `Parameters` class is to expose it as a public field in a `MonoBehaviour` class. This way you can set the parameters in the Unity Inspector.

```csharp
using AiToolbox;
using UnityEngine;

public class DalleExample : MonoBehaviour {
    public Parameters parameters;
    <...>
}
```

You can also create a `Parameters` instance is to use one of the constructors. The `Parameters` class also provides a copy constructor that can be used to create a copy of an existing `Parameters` instance.

### Properties

- `apiKey`: The API key for {{ site.dalle }}. This property is required. You can find your API key on the [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys){:target="_blank"} page.
- `apiKeyEncryption`: The encryption method for the API key. This property is optional. The default value is `ApiKeyEncryption.None`.
- `apiKeyRemoteConfigKey`: The remote configuration key for the API key. This property is required if `apiKeyEncryption` is set to `ApiKeyEncryption.RemoteConfig`. This value is the key of the remote configuration entry in [Unity Remote Config](https://unity.com/products/remote-config){:target="_blank"} that contains the API key.
- `apiKeyEncryptionPassword`: The password used for API key encryption. This property is required if `apiKeyEncryption` is set to `ApiKeyEncryption.Encrypted`. This value is used to encrypt the API key before it is stored in the Unity scene.
- `model`: The {{ site.dalle }} model to use for the request.
- `size`: The size of the image to generate. The default value is 1024x1024. All sizes supported by the {{ site.dalle }} API are listed.
- `quality`: The quality of the image to generate. The default value is `standard`. The quality options are `standard` and `hd`.

## Pricing

The up-to-date {{ site.dalle }} pricing can be found in the "Image models" section of the [OpenAI Documentation](https://openai.com/pricing#image-generation){:target="_blank"}.
