With {{ site.title_short }}, you can use the power of AI both in the Unity Editor and in your shipped games. It allows you to generate C# scripts from text descriptions, and generate images from text descriptions, including seamlessly tiling ones, right in your project.

## Using AI in the Unity Editor

**ChatGPT** is a powerful AI model that can generate code and images from text descriptions. It can be used to generate scripts for any purpose, including game mechanics, behavior, UI, etc.

With {{ site.title_short }} you can [generate](/getting-started/#generating-scripts) scripts and they will be automatically integrated into your Unity Project. This streamlined process allows you to _focus on the creative aspects of your project while reducing the time spent on manual coding_.

You can also [edit](/getting-started/#editing-scripts) any script with {{ site.title_short }}, both generated and hand-written.

**DALL•E** is an advanced AI model that generates images from text descriptions. It can be used to generate textures, UI elements, reference images, etc. {{ site.title_short }} allows you to do this right in your Unity project, even generating seamlessly tiling images.

Using {{ site.title_short }}, you can also generate shaders and UI documents from simple text descriptions.

**New!** We've added support for **Google Bard**. Now for any question or script you can use both ChatGPT and Bard! Check out [Bard Setup Guide](/bard-set-up/) for more details. You can [choose](/bard-set-up/#google-bard-models) between PaLM 2 and Gemini Pro models.

## Important Notices

This asset works with both free and paid OpenAI accounts, but we recommend checking if you have remaining OpenAI usage quota before buying. To check, please enter a prompt in the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground){:target="_blank"}. If you get an error, you probably have exhausted the free API credit and may need to purchase more in the [OpenAI Billing section](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview){:target="_blank"}.
{:.notice--info}

Please be aware that both ChatGPT and Bard, being AI models, **may sometimes generate scripts that cannot be compiled** and will show errors in the Unity Console. While we strive to improve the accuracy and functionality of the generated scripts, we have no direct control over the AI's output.
