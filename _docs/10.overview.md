### Important Notices

This asset works with both free and paid OpenAI accounts, but we recommend checking if you have remaining OpenAI usage quota before buying. To check, please enter a prompt in the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground){:target="_blank"}. If you get an error, you probably have exhausted the free API credit and may need to purchase more in the [OpenAI Billing section](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview){:target="_blank"}.
{:.notice--info}

Please be aware that both ChatGPT and Gemini, being AI models, **may sometimes generate scripts that cannot be compiled** and will show errors in the Unity Console. While we strive to improve the accuracy and functionality of the generated scripts, we have no direct control over the AI's output.
