Once you [set up](/installation/) {{ site.title_short }}, you can start using it to [generate](/getting-started/#generating-scripts) and [edit C# scripts](/getting-started/#editing-scripts), [generate images](/getting-started/#generating-images-with-dalle), shaders and UI documents for your Unity projects.

## Generating Scripts

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cNq-uCBq5yU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


To generate a script with ChatGPT or Gemini, you'll need to open the prompt window. There are two ways to do this:

1. In the Unity Editor, select a GameObject and click the **“Generate Component”** button in
the Inspector.
1. **Type a prompt** describing the C# script you would like the AI to generate.
1. Click **"Generate"**, and the script will be automatically created.

Press **Generate Component** button to open the prompt box

Alternatively, to open this window you can right-click in the **Project** tab ▶︎ select **Create** ▶︎ click **C# Script by ChatGPT** or use the shortcut: `Alt+Shift+S` (Windows) or `Option+Shift+S` (Mac).

![](../assets/images/manual_images/sg-create-c-sharp-script.png){: .image-rounded }

Type your request in the prompt window and click **"Generate and Add"** to start the script generation process. You can also use `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd+Return` (Mac). The generated script will be added to your project (by default in `Assets/Generated`, but you can choose the destination in the _Output Path_ field in the [General Settings](/getting-started/#general-settings)).

- **Advanced Options** — if expanded, reveals the [**Temperature**](/getting-started/#temperature), [**Timeout**](/getting-started/#timeout), [**History**](/getting-started/#prompt-history) parameters, [How To Write Prompts](/how-to-write-prompts/) button , mirrored from the [_Settings panel_](/getting-started/#ai-script-generator-settings) (which can be found in _Edit_ ▶︎ _Project Settings_ ▶︎ _{{ site.title_short }}_).

- **Save to History** — enable this option to save the generated script to the history. [_History_](/getting-started/#prompt-history) can be accessed with the "_History_" button in this window or in the [_Settings panel_](/getting-started/#ai-script-generator-settings).

- **Chatbot** - the menu for choosing the Backend for generating the scripts. Currently, there are two options: _OpenAI ChatGPT_, _Azure ChatGPT_ and _Google Gemini_. The default chatbot is _OpenAI ChatGPT_. The Backend used for [Chat with AI](/chat/) can be changed in _Chat with AI_ window's Settings.

_AI Toolbox_ looks whether the generation is going successfully or it is going to have potential errors. If the script generation went without errors, by default you will have a new script in your project (by default, in `Assets/Generated`, but you can choose the destination in the _Output Path_ field in the [General Settings](/getting-started/#general-settings)).
If you have the _Auto-accept_ option turned off, you'll be presented with an according window in the end each generation process. To change this option, go to the [General Settings](/getting-started/#general-settings) and check the _Auto-accept new files_ checkbox.

- **Edit Prompt** - This will open the prompt window containing the prompt text that was used to generate the script.
- **Reject** - This will discard the changes made by editing the script.
- **Open File** - This will open the script file in the default text editor.
- **Accept** - This will accept the changes to the script.

### If Editing the Script Results in Errors

{{ site.title_short }} sees if the code that is being generated has errors and does not compile. {{ site.title_short }} will give a few options to address that. If you have any errors when the script is generated, the look of the script generation window will change to the following:

- **Ask ChatGPT to Fix It** - This will submit the current code along with the error description and will ask AI to fix the code.
- **Revert and Edit Prompt** - This will discard the changes made by editing the script.
- **Accept and Edit File** - This will accept the changes and will open the script file to be edited manually. This option is useful if you want to fix the error yourself.
- **Accept** - This will accept the changes as is and save the script.

## Generating Images with DALL•E

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HlO9LsTLW0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{ site.title_short }} can generate images using the [DALL•E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/). You only need to write a text description of the image you want it to produce. The prompt can be as simple as "A brick wall texture" or as complex as "A futuristic retro space ship landing on a snow-covered planet". The more complex the prompt, the more specific the image will be.

To open the DALL•E generation propmt window, right-click anywhere in the Project tab and select **Create** ▶︎ **Texture by DALL•E**.

<a href="/assets/images/manual_images/dall-e-texture-by-dall-e.png">

</a>

{:.image-caption}
'Generate texture by DALL•E' menu item

You'll need to type your prompt in the prompt field and click **Generate** to start the generation process. You can also use `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd+Return` (Mac).

- **Resolution** - Opens a drop down menu where you can select the resolution of the image to be generated. The options are: _256x256 px_, _512x512 px_, _1024x1024 px_. These are all resolutions that DALL•E currently supports.
- **Tileable** - Generates a texture that can be seamlessly tiled.
    - **Seam Size** - The size of the seam if _Tileable_ generating is enabled. The default value is 0.05.
- **Left/Right Arrow Buttons** — view the previous and next prompts from History.
- **Advanced Options** — if expanded, reveals the [**Timeout**](/getting-started/#general-settings), **Save to History** parameters, [Settings](/getting-started/#ai-toolbox-settings) button and [How To Write Prompts](/how-to-write-prompts/), and [**History**](/getting-started/#prompt-history) buttons, mirrored from the [_Settings panel_](/getting-started/#ai-toolbox-settings) (which can be found in _Edit_ ▶︎ _Project Settings_ ▶︎ _{{ site.title_short }}_).

When the generation is completed the following menu will appear:
- **Prompt field** - This is the field where you can edit the prompt.
- **Save and Regenerate** - This will save the generated image to the folder set in [Output Path](/getting-started/#general-settings) (by default, it is `Assets/Generated`) and will generate another image without closing this window.
- **Discard and Regenerate** - This will discard the generated image and will generate another image without closing this window.
- **Done** - This will close the window and will save the generated image to the folder set in [Output Path](/getting-started/#general-settings) (by default, it is `Assets/Generated`).

## Generating Shaders

You can generate shaders with {{ site.title_short }}. To do that, you need to have a prompt that contains the text description of the shader you want to generate.

We've found that the best way to have successful results is to generate a very simple shader and then gradually add more complexity using the **Follow-up** button, which appears upon every generation process completion (described below in this paragraph), or you can use the [Edit Shader](#editing-shaders) feature.

Please note that the outcome of the generation process completely depends on the AI model's code writing abilities.
{:.notice--warning}

To open the shader generation propmt window, right-click anywhere in the Project tab (or click **+** there) and select **Create** ▶︎ **Shader** ▶︎ **ChatGPT**. Alternatively, you can go to _Window_ ▶︎ _{{ site.title_short }}_ ▶︎ _Generate Shader_.

When the generation process is completed, a menu will appear with the following options:
- **Edit Prompt** - This won't save the shader and will open the prompt window where you can edit the prompt to make another generation attempt. Shortcut: `Backspace`.
- **Reject** - This will reject the generated shader and will close the window. Shortcut: `Esc`.
- **Follow-up** - Iterate with ChatGPT on the generated code.
- **Open File** - This will open the generated shader file in the default application for the file type. Shortcut: `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Return`.
- **Accept** - This will save the generated shader and will close the window. Shortcut: `Enter`.

## {{ site.title_short }} Settings

All settings can be found in Edit ▶︎ Project Settings ▶︎ {{ site.title_short }}.

### OpenAI API Key

- **API Key** is the field where you will need to paste your API Key, once it is generated [(here is more info on API Key generation)](/installation/#api-key-generation).
- **Use Proxy Server** - Use the proxy URL for the OpenAI API. Once you click the _Use Proxy Server_ button, the short guide on how to obtain a free API key will appear.

<a href="/assets/images/manual_images/sg-project-settings-proxy-server-guide.png">
![Proxy Server settings and guide](/assets/images/manual_images/sg-project-settings-proxy-server-guide.png)
</a>

{:.image-caption}
Proxy Server settings and guide

⚠️ The API key is stored in the following file: `UserSettings/AiToolbox.asset`. When sharing your project with others, be sure to **exclude the "UserSettings" directory** to prevent unauthorized use of your API key. Even though the API key is encrypted, any client-only security measure can be circumvented.
{:.notice--danger}

{:.image-caption}
OpenAI ChatGPT API Key and other settings

- **Model** is the GPT model that will be used to generate scripts. Currently, there are two options: _gpt-3.5-turbo_ and _GPT-4_. The default model is _gpt-3.5-turbo_.
- **Model version** — the version of the model to use. This list is constantly updated with the new versions as they are released. [More on Models here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models){:target="_blank"}
- **Extended context** Uses a variant of gpt-3.5-turbo that can work with much longer code. It allows 4 times more context, handling up to 20 pages of text/code in a single request. However, it costs twice as much: $0.003 per 1K input tokens and $0.004 per 1K output tokens.


### Microsoft Azure

You can access ChatGPT using Microsoft Azure. It provides the same models as OpenAI, but has more control over the backend. Plus, it's also very cheap and has a one month free trial.
The detailed step-by-step guide on the Microsoft Azure setup is [here](/azure-set-up/).

### Generation Settings

- **Default temperature** controls randomness: higher _Temperature_ results in more random completions. As the _Temperature_ approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and repetitive. Lower the _Temperature_ to get more or less the same results when you re-iterate script generation. Raise the _Temperature_ to get more diverse, creative and surprising results upon each completion. Current default _Temperature_ is 0.

### Guiding Prompts

_Guiding Prompts_ are used to help the model produce results that are more relevant to your project. All guiding prompts are submitted to AI along with every prompt you type in the prompt window.

- **Result Type** - this is the drop down menu where you can recall the predefined guiding prompts for different types of generated files (scripts, shaders, UI documents and textures).
- **+** and **Trash Bin** buttons add and remove guiding prompts.
- **Checkboxes** enable or disable guiding prompts without deleting them.
- **Reset to default** resets the guiding prompts to the default values.

### General Settings

- **Timeout** - if enabled, the _Duration_ field appears. If AI doesn't respond within the _Duration_ parameter of the _Timeout_, generation fails. Try increasing this value if ChatGPT or Gemini often outputs a 'timeout' error. If that does not resolve it, please take a look at [this paragraph](/faq/#i-am-getting-a-timeout-issue). If disabled, the generation process will wait for a response from AI indefinitely.
- **Duration** - is the time in seconds that {{ site.title_short }} will wait for a response from ChatGPT or Gemini.
- **Output Path** - is the path where generated files will be saved when you use the _"Generate Component"_ button in Inspector. By default, it is set to `Assets/Generated`.
- **Inspector button** - if enabled, the _"Generate Component"_ button appears on every Game Object's Inspector panel.
- **Auto-accept new files** - if enabled, {{ site.title_short }} will automatically save generated scripts into the Unity project. If disabled, script generation window will stay open and you will be able to choose a further action with the script.
- **Auto-accept edits** - if enabled, {{ site.title_short }} will automatically save script edits to the edited file. If disabled, script editing window will stay open and you will be able to choose a further action with the script. More info about these actions can be found [here](/getting-started/#editing-scripts).
